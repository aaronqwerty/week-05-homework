## Description

Week five homework requires the creation of a work day schedules (calendar) using Third Party API's which we learned this week, as well as additional JavaScript, CSS & HTML which we had already learned in previous weeks.

This project uses the following;

- html
- JavaScript
- CSS

For this project we were provided the basic html & css and just needed to complete the Javascript code.

I decided to add a blinking ':' for the main time so the user knows the clock is live and not static and a clear schedule button to clear everything as well as a 12/24 hour time selector so the user can toggle either on or off depending on what they prefer.


## Installation
